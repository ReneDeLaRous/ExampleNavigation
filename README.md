# ExampleNavigation

In this App I have created an example about how to navigate between two activities
Using class Intent and two Activities
Also I used a textview called "Primer Activity" and Button called Siguiente,
And the other Activity with a textview called "Segunda Activity" and button called Anterior,

So, this way when we press click on every button we are changing between activities.
